# Project Name
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

This project indicates

## Conclusions
The R-squared value of 0.76 suggests that the model has a good fit. 
This means that 76% of the variability in the target variable can be explained by the independent variables in the model.
R-squared of 0.76 indicates a robust linear regression model, suggesting a solid relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
